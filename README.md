##Profile

(A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.)

I have a passion for technology and how it can make our lives easier, more efficient, connected, and improve the transfer of knowledge. After a successful sales career at two software companies, I've decided to take on a more technical role to understand how technologies work and focus on product development.

Sales taught me a lot about understanding **why** certain components are important to the customer. My next objective is to focus on the **how** and build out new platforms to meet ever-growing needs.

January 2017: I will be available for hire in Sydney, Australia.

- International experience across the US, Germany, UK and soon to be Australia
- Ability to understand different markets and cultures quickly
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### I am hungry

*The world is your oyster*
- At Bazaarvoice, I tried to learn about the company and inner workings of a global business as much as possible. I sat in on various trainings sessions from Salesforce, Marketo and Leadership, always trying to understand more about how processes work and what makes for a successful operation. I proactively shadowed different departments, which strengthened my understanding of how each part of an organisation contributes, and most importantly helped me find out what it is that I really want to do (code!).
- Personally, I am constantly learning and trying new things. While in in London I brought back my former love of running. In March 2015 I could run 2.5 miles. By November 2015 I completed the Istanbul Marathon. I also earned the Royal Yachting Association's Dinghy Certification.
- Most recently, I've been mastering my skills in the kitchen.
