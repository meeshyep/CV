##Profile

I have a passion for technology and how it can make our lives easier, more efficient, connected, and improve the transfer of knowledge. After a successful sales career at two software companies, I've decided to take on a more technical role to understand how technologies work and focus on product development. 

I am driven by the idea that software and technology can be used to impact people and our planet for the better. Joining a company that values working on projects which achieve Tech for Good initiatives would be an ideal environment to start this next step. 

Sales taught me a lot about understanding **why** certain components are important to the customer. My next objective is to focus on the **how** and build out new platforms to meet ever-growing needs. You can follow my progression of learning in the projects below:

**ChoreMatick**: <h5>Amazon Alexa Skill that allows parents to provide a list of chores for their child. | Java, DynamoDB, AWS, JUnit, Mockito| [Link](https://github.com/ChoreMatick/ChoreMatick/tree/master/chorematick)</h5> <br>
**Wakey-Wakey**:<h5>The alarm clock that gets you out of bed | React Native, iOS, Xcode | [Link](https://github.com/meeshyep/Wakey-Wakey-)</h5> <br>
