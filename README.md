## Michelle Marie Epstein

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

I have a passion for technology and how it can make our lives easier, more efficient, connected, and improve the transfer of knowledge. After a successful sales career at two software companies, I've decided to take on a more technical role to understand how technologies work and focus on product development. 

Sales taught me a lot about understanding Why certain components are important to the customer. My next objective is to focus on the How and build out new platforms to meet ever-growing needs.

January 2017: I will be available for hire in Sydney, Australia.
