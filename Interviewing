###Interview Objections
___
Q: "You can’t learn to code in 12 weeks!”
___

Respond:
Agree with it, then talk about what else you have learned that’s really valuable- teamwork, learning process.
Point out that you were coding for quite some time before the course.
Actually I’ve learned a huge amount in 12 weeks, and I’m aware of how much more there is to know.
- I have best practices, not bad habits.
- Learning how to learn. Not being hired for what i know right now in this interview. I'm being hired for what i can learn incredibly quickly. Where can I be in another 16 weeks?
- Knowledge Worker
___
Q: You don't know the languages we use. "You can't do [Java, C#] - that's what we do here"
___

Respond:
Demonstrate that you have learned new languages in short order- can learn another.
Get them to challenge you- learn the language in a set space of time.

- Who might say this?
Recruitment, Development team members, anyone

- Why might they be saying this?
Lack of CS degree, uninformed of Bootcamp curriculum, portfolio not extensive enough

- How do you respond?
We're knowledge workers, Makers Academy is about learning how to learn, have proven track record of being adaptable and learning quickly, applying best practices, know XP values, understand languages/frameworks with ease, languages go in and out of fashion so having languages as a concrete skill isn't as necessary as the developer skills, also they can give us a challenge and then we can go learn it and present. also discuss about the rate of learning - what we can do right now isn't impressive, but what we've learned to do in 12 weeks is way more impressive. i learned how to do this in 2 weeks.
___
Q: "You're not experienced enough"
___

Respond: This is often a reflection of the insecurity/concerns of the person doing the hiring- HR who doesn’t know what the job role really is, CEO of startup who isn’t technical, worried about hiring someone who can’t work.
Who might say this?
Why might they be saying this?
How could you respond? Course is all built on working in teams, collaborating on software and drawing on other people's ideas.
- I have 12 weeks learning how to be a developer, not just in one specific technology/language, but i have learned how to be a developer.

___
Q: "You would need too much mentorship and the business is not at a stage where we can provide that" or “You won’t deliver immediate value and might even be a drain on senior engineers”
___

Respond:
Everyone starting a new job in a new company will need mentoring
We have proven ourselves on this course that we don’t need someone hovering over us.
We won’t come in with bias as to how a tech company/this company should work.
-Who might say this?
-Why might they be saying this?
-How could you respond? We're independent problem solvers, we're literally not taught anything, but rather pick everything up on our own accord
___
Q: "You don't have enough computer science knowledge"
___

Respond:
CS grads learn to code on their own time, not on the course.
Traditional teaching won’t give them the appropriate work place skills
CS degrees take 3 years, ours is up to date, theirs is crusty.
Lots of theory, not much practice.

-Who might say this?
-Why might they be saying this?
-How could you respond? I'm not learning to be a Computer Scientist, i'm learning to be a developer. the massive gap makers was trying to fill was the gap of developers. What do I need to be able to do from a computer science degree? Do you use this everyday? Is it relevant for this job? What is the business need, what's the problem that I can solve?

WILL BENTINCK WROTE THIS EMAIL:
___
We train our developers to be tech-agnostic, able to fit in to any team, in any stack. The tech is not the most important bit, it's everything else they learn that is: teamwork, best practice, TDD, agile, communication, delivering value to a user - and, most importantly, independent problem-solving.
For example,
Compare the Market have hired 8 of our graduates into C#;
Deloitte Digital have hired 15 of them into Java and are looking for another 20;
Holiday Extras are recruiting right now in Node.js;
Financial Times recently hired 7 people into a number of front-end technologies; and
we have hiring partners in Scala, F#, Ruby (and Rails), Python, PHP, .NET, iOS, Android and many more.
So yes, they learn Ruby and Javascript at Makers Academy, but that doesn't stop them over-delivering in every team they join, regardless of technologies.
Shall we have a chat on the phone tomorrow?
