___
Q: You don't know the languages we use. "You can't do [Java, C#] - that's what we do here"
___

```
- Who might say this?
-- Recruitment, Development team members, anyone

- Why might they be saying this?
-- Lack of CS degree, uninformed of Bootcamp curriculum, portfolio not extensive enough

- How do you respond?
-- We're knowledge workers, Makers Academy is about learning how to learn, have proven track record of being adaptable and learning quickly, applying best practices, know XP values, understand languages/frameworks with ease, languages go in and out of fashion so having languages as a concrete skill isn't as neccessary as the developer skills, also they can give us a challenge and then we can go learn it and present. also discuss about the rate of learning - what we can do right now isn't impressive, but what we've learned to do in 12 weeks is way more impressive. i learned how to do this in 2 weeks.

```

___
Q: "You don't have enough computer science knowledge"
___

```
Who might say this?
Why might they be saying this?
How could you respond? I'm not learning to be a Computer Scientist, i'm learning to be a developer. the massive gap makers was trying to fill was the gap of developers. What do I need to be able to do from a computer science degree? Do you use this everyday? Is it relevant for this job? What is the business need, what's the problem that I can solve?
